# Description

This is an Airbnb-based app built on Ruby on Rails integrating React as the front-end. The objective of the app is to allow users to listing their property for rental for a duration of time. Users can be split into two categories either: hosts or temporary tenants. Tenants can explore listings on the app and book houses, apartments, condos, studios, etc by contacting the host. 

# MVP Goals

The main MVP goal is to allow users to register accounts and sign into the site with a protected security measure using authentication. After users have successfully signed up, users will be allowed to put up their homes, vacation homes, apartments, etc for public listing where other users can rent the space for an a period of time.

Initially for the cloned Airbnb app, owners will have their property listed on the app. However, if a user wishes to book the property for a period of time, there will be a contact form or a form to submit to the owner.

Each property must be assigned to one user, meaning that a single individual user can have multiple homes on the listings.

# Post-MVP goals

For Post-MVP, I would like to get rid of the contact form or a form to submit to the owner. Eventually, the app should be functioning like Airbnb and allow users to book properites directly on the app.

Other interesting tools/functionalities I'd also like to add are a calendar to book places, a calculator tool for homeowners to figure out monthly revenue based on the location (similar to the Airbnb app), and possibly add activites to also do in the area of the home.

# Technologies used

The Airbnb App is built on Ruby on Rails as the backend and integrates React as the frontend.

## List of server-side routes

# Major challenges Expected:

For this app, I expect some of the harder challenges to be the user authenication where they can securely sign up and login into the app. Additionally, adding security measures such as restrict on certain pages where only users can access, modify, or delete those pages. Lastly, I feel as if I may run into minor issues with linking the properties to home owners.
